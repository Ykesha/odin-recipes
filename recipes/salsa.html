<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Salsa is used as a condiment for tacos and other Mexican and Mexican-American foods. It may also be used as a dip for tortilla chips. Salsa may be either raw or cooked, and is typically served at room temperature.</p>

<p>Although the word salsa means "sauce" in Spanish, in English, it refers specifically to different kids of Mexican table sauces, such chunky tomato-and-chili-based pico de gallo, and salsa verde.</p>
